### **Observability Use Case: Multi-Cluster Monitoring with Cortex**

In a scenario with multiple Kubernetes clusters, each hosting distinct workloads for customers (e.g., Customer A, B, and C), Prometheus and Grafana are deployed within each cluster for metrics collection and visualization. However, due to the large volume of metrics data generated, storing all metrics locally in Prometheus is infeasible. 

**Solution**: Implement **Cortex** as a centralized metrics storage system. Cortex supports multi-tenancy, allowing metrics from each cluster to be isolated per customer. Prometheus instances forward metrics to Cortex using the **remote write endpoint**. Cortex retains data for 7 days and offloads older data to cost-effective cloud storage solutions such as **AWS S3**, **Google Cloud Storage**, or **Azure Blob Storage**. Grafana is configured to use Cortex as a data source, enabling a centralized and unified monitoring solution.

### **Action Plan**

1. **Set up Kubernetes Clusters**:
   - Create 3 Kubernetes clusters.
2. **Deploy Monitoring Components**:
   - Deploy Cortex in one cluster.
   - Deploy Prometheus in the other two clusters.
3. **Configure Long-Term Storage**:
   - Set up a cloud storage backend (e.g., S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage) and configure Cortex to offload older data.
4. **Visualize with Grafana**:
   - Deploy Grafana in the same cluster as Cortex and configure it to use Cortex as a data source.
5. **Enable Remote Write**:
   - Configure Prometheus instances to send metrics to Cortex using the **remote write** feature.
6. **Deploy Workloads**:
   - Deploy the NGINX workload in one namespace of a cluster.
   - Deploy an HTTPS workload in a different namespace of another cluster.
7. **Validate Setup**:
   - Verify metrics from Prometheus and workloads are accessible and visualized correctly in Grafana.

### **Learning Objectives**

- **Kubernetes Setup**: Configure and manage multiple Kubernetes clusters.
- **Prometheus**: Learn to deploy and configure Prometheus for metrics collection.
- **Cortex**: Set up Cortex for multi-tenant, centralized metrics storage and integration with cloud storage.
- **Grafana**: Configure Grafana for centralized visualization of metrics.

### **Next Use Case**: Deploy and Configure Tracing Tools  
Explore tools like **Splunk**, **Dynatrace**, or **Fluent Bit** for implementing tracing and log aggregation.

These two use cases together cover key aspects of **Observability**, including metrics, logs, and tracing.
